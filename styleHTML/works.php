      <h1>Our Work</h1>
      <p>At Pet Adoption Center, our mission is to help as many animals as we can find loving forever homes. Since we opened our doors in 2010, we've helped hundreds of animals find their perfect match. Here are some of our success stories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Buddy</h2>
          <img src="../pictures/man-1351317__480.webp" alt="Buddy">
          <p>Buddy is a six-year-old labrador mix who came to us from a local shelter. He had been surrendered by his previous owner and was very anxious in the shelter environment. We worked with him to build up his confidence and find him a loving home. Buddy is now living with a family who loves him dearly and takes him on daily walks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Luna</h2>
          <img src="../pictures/woman-5716875__480.webp" alt="Luna">
          <p>Luna is a three-year-old calico cat who was found wandering the streets. She was very shy and scared when she first arrived at our center, but with some love and patience, she came out of her shell. Luna was adopted by a retired couple who have been spoiling her with treats and toys ever since.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Rex</h2>
          <img src="../pictures/woman.webp" alt="Rex">
          <p>Rex is a two-year-old pitbull who was surrendered by his owner due to a change in their living situation. He was very energetic and playful, but had never been properly trained. We worked with him to teach him basic obedience commands and found him a family who was willing to continue his training. Rex is now a well-behaved and beloved member of his new family.</p>
