      <h2>  TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ADOPTION</h2>
      <h4>
1. Any information concerning the habits and past history of the Animal is passed on <br>by the RSPCA to the Adopter in good faith. This 
information has been provided to assist with the adoption process and successful adoption<br> of the Animal which may have come to the 
RSPCA’s care for example, by being signed over by the Animal’s previous owner, found abandoned,<br> lost and of unknown background. 
The information we provide you may be based on statements made by the previous owner or the RSPCA <br>Inspectorate and/or 
assessments or observations of the animal whilst in the RSPCA’s care. We cannot guarantee that this<br> information is correct despite <br>
making every effort being made.<br> Please see www.rspca.org.uk/findapet/rehomeapet/process for our rehoming policy.<br>
<br> 2. The Animal is believed to be in normal health on leaving the animal establishment except where <br>specific conditions have been made 
known to the Adopter on the Animal Adoption Form and the responsibility for and cost of any<br> future veterinary or other treatment shall <br>
be borne solely by the Adopter save where Clause 4 applies.<br>
<br>3. The animal’s welfare is our priority and we will work with you to resolve any<br> concerns or questions you have in respect of the Animal <br>
after adoption and we ask you to contact the RSPCA branch or animal centre<br> where you adopted the animal giving full details as soon <br>
as possible.<br>
<br>4. Nothing in these terms will affect your legal rights including those<br> under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (and other consumer protection <br>
laws). Please contact your local Consumer Advice or<br> Trading Standards Department for more information about this.<br>
<br>5. The RSPCA strongly advises the Adopter to arrange appropriate <br>insurance cover against risks referred to in this Agreement and also <br>
the costs of veterinary treatment.<br>
<br>6. The Adopter confirms that to the best of their knowledge and <br>belief no person residing in their household, or who will care for the <br>
Animal, is disqualified from keeping animals or has had a deprivation <br>order made under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and/or has an <br>
unspent conviction for offences relating to animals. <br>
<br>7. Attention is drawn to the possible liability of the Adopter for damage<br> and injury which they may cause to third parties or their property.<br> In 
particular liability may arise under the Animals Act 1971.<br> The possibility of an action for nuisance against the Adopter as a result of the <br>
Animal’s behaviour should also be recognised.<br> The RSPCA strongly advises the Adopter to arrange appropriate insurance cover <br>
against risks referred to in this Agreement and also the costs<br> of veterinary treatment. For a competitive quote visit www.RSPCApetinsurance.co.uk<br>
<br>8. The Adopter agrees to comply with all relevant regulations, legislation<br> and laws concerning the welfare, control, responsible ownership 
and protection of animals including without limitation the Animal Welfare<br> Act 2006 and Codes of Practice issued in England and Wales 
under the 2006 Act and to ensure that anyone with the temporary care of <br>the Animal also complies The welfare needs of the animal <br>
means providing for the animal’s health, happiness and taking measures<br> to ensure that the animal’s health is maintained, in that he/she <br>
is properly housed, fed, watered, socialised and exercised and receives<br> appropriate veterinary care, including vaccination, regular <br>
worming and flea treatment, as appropriate to the species.<br>
<br>9. If a dog, cat, rabbit, ferret, male guinea pig or male horse<br> is unneutered at the time of adoption, the Adopter agrees to having the Animal 
neutered as soon as possible unless there are overriding <br>veterinary reasons for it not being possible. <br>
<br>10. When adopting a dog, cat, rabbit, ferret or horse <br>(or any other microchipped animal), the adopter agrees for their personal data to be <br>
passed to the microchip database by the RSPCA for the<br> purposes of registering the microchip. The Adopter agrees to maintain the <br>
microchip records of the animal, by informing the microchip <br>database of any changes of address or ownership of the animal postadoption. This also applies to Equine Passports,<br> where your personal details will be passed to the passport issuing authority.<br>
<br>11. The Adopter agrees not to irresponsibly sell or part <br>with the animal. Further information can be found at

<br>12. Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit the <br>RSPCA’s liability for fraud, or for the death or personal injury caused by <br>
its negligence or any other liability or consumer rights <br>which it cannot legally exclude or limit. 
<br>13. This Agreement is between the Adopter and the RSPCA <br>and no other party has the right to enforce the terms of this Agreement <br>
<br>14. If court or relevant authority finds any part of this Agreement to<br> be unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement shall continue in force as <br>
each of these terms operates separately.<br>
<br>15. The English and Welsh Courts will have exclusive jurisdiction <br>over any claim arising from or related to this Agreement. English and <br>
Welsh law will apply to this Agreement<br></h4>
